            "Added a new agent-style YAML header replacing the site/extension metadata, including explicit `model: gpt-4o`, a `skills` block, and an expanded tool list.",
            "Added support for **incremental journaling workflows**: create today’s note if missing, then return throughout the day to update only a selected section.",
            "Added **section selector** workflow with explicit supported sections: Morning Intentions, Gratitude, Daily Log Entry, Manage Tasks, Evening Reflection, Mood & Energy Check-in, and Add Related Links.",
            "Added **Tasks integration** via the `obsidian-tasks` skill, including viewing tasks in today’s note and actions to add, complete, review/filter, reschedule, and remove tasks (with emoji-based Tasks metadata like 📅, ✅, ⏫, 🔁).",
            "Added **Mood & energy tracking** that saves `mood:` and `energy:` into YAML frontmatter for longitudinal tracking.",
            "Added **writing style modes** for narrative sections (Full narrative, Light polish, Exact words) selected once per session when first entering a narrative-eligible section.",
            "Added an explicit **preview-before-save** step for narrative sections so users can request edits prior to writing changes.",
            "Added detailed end-to-end **Examples** (Morning setup, Midday log append, Task management, Evening wrap-up) that document expected agent behavior and outputs.",
            "Rewrote the README from a short “features + simple usage prompts” guide into a **process-driven specification** describing tool calls, decision points, and save behavior step-by-step.",
            "Changed the core behavior from “create structured entries” to **create-or-update** with a strong emphasis on **not overwriting existing content**.",
            "Expanded tooling from read/create + daily note access to include **note updates** (`update_note`) and **interactive question flows** (`ask_question`), plus task-management tools.",
            "Changed “Journal Structure” from a fixed list (including Goals Progress) to a **section-based workflow**, with goals now described as being captured in frontmatter during Evening Reflection (rather than a dedicated “Goals Progress” section).",
            "Changed Daily Log and Related Links behavior to be explicitly **append-oriented**, accumulating content across the day rather than replacing existing text.",
            "Changed the “pattern recognition” concept into “continuity and pattern awareness,” explicitly noting it should support reflection **without rewriting structured data**.",
            "Changed usage guidance from single-command examples (e.g., “Start my journal for today”) to a **guided multi-step flow** (start session → choose section → answer one question at a time → preview → save only what changed → continue/stop).",
            "Addressed the risk of unintended overwrites by specifying a **read-then-update-only-the-chosen-section** save process using `read_note` + `update_note`, preserving all other content.",
            "Standardized metadata maintenance by requiring `modified-date` in frontmatter to be updated to “today” on each save.",
            "Removed extension-site frontmatter fields (e.g., `layout`, `permalink`, `identifier`, `version`, `repository`, `license_url`, `categories`, `tags`, `versions`, `size`, and the embedded historical change list).",
            "Removed the Installation section that referenced the Extension Browser and manual copying instructions.",
            "Removed the Tools Used table in favor of describing tool usage inline as part of the workflow.",
            "Removed the “Tips” section and the standalone “Changelog v1.0.0” section from the README content.",
            "Removed the explicit “License: MIT” section from the body of the README."

            "Added explicit **Create vs. Update mode** framing in the overview, describing what the agent does when today’s note is missing vs. already exists.",
            "Added a dedicated **Create mode** section explaining that the agent generates the full daily journal structure (frontmatter + all standard sections) before prompting for the first section to fill.",
            "Added a more explicit **safe update workflow** for section updates, including that updates target content **between a section heading and the next heading**.",
            "Added detailed **task formatting rules** for Obsidian Tasks, including:",
            "Added clearer documentation that **structured fields remain verbatim**, explicitly including **goals** and **tags** (in addition to mood/energy/tasks).",
            "Added “Preview-first for rewritten sections” as a first-class feature item (highlighting preview before saving narrative rewrites).",
            "Rewrote the opening description from a workflow-heavy explanation to a concise “thoughtful journaling assistant” summary emphasizing **focused prompts**, **optional narrative rewriting**, and **preserving existing writing**.",
            "Reworked “Brief overview” from “two core workflows” into “two modes” with clearer, tighter definitions and an explicit note that the agent can manage tasks via Obsidian Tasks metadata.",
            "Consolidated and reorganized the **Features** list from detailed tool-by-tool behavior into higher-level capabilities, while still calling out:",
            "Updated the **writing style options** wording and descriptions:",
            "Restructured **Usage instructions**:",
            "Expanded and clarified **task management** behavior:",
            "Updated the **Examples** section:",
            "Removed the explicit “Special cases” breakdown that previously enumerated behavior for Daily Log, Related Links, Mood/Energy (with exact `mood:` / `energy:` field names), and Tasks as separate bullet rules.",
            "Removed the dedicated **Task management example** walkthrough (previous “Example C”), replacing it with a more formal task rules section plus shorter scenario examples.",
            "Removed the documented optional behavior to set `status: complete` in frontmatter when finishing the day."
