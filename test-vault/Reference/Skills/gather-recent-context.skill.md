Gather recent context from the vault to help orient the current session.

**Collect:**

2. **Open tasks** — Incomplete tasks from recent daily notes
3. **Active projects** — Projects with recent activity
4. **Recent tags** — Frequently used tags from recent notes

Compile a brief context summary that can be used to inform the current work session.
