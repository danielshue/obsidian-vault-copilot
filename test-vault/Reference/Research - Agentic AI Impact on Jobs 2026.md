# Research: Agentic AI Impact on Jobs (2026)

**Research Question**: How are AI agents transforming employment, and what does this mean for workers, employers, and society?

**Purpose**: Background research for blog post on agentic AI's impact on the job market.

---

## 1. Current Statistics on AI and Job Displacement/Transformation

### Key Findings

**Job Transformation vs. Displacement**
- Studies show AI augments more jobs than it replaces (estimated 60-80% augmentation vs. 15-25% displacement)
- World Economic Forum (2023-2025): Projected 85M jobs displaced, 97M new roles created by 2025
- McKinsey Global Institute: By 2030, 15-30% of work activities could be automated, affecting 400-800M workers globally
- Goldman Sachs (2023): AI could automate equivalent of 300M full-time jobs, but boost global GDP by 7%

**Sectors Most Affected**
- High impact: Customer service, data entry, basic coding, content moderation, administrative support
- Moderate impact: Healthcare diagnostics, legal research, financial analysis, graphic design
- Lower impact (human-centric): Nursing, teaching, strategic leadership, creative direction, trades

**Timeline Reality Check**
- 2024-2026: Adoption phase—AI agents move from experiments to production
- 2026-2028: Transformation phase—widespread workforce changes begin
- 2028-2030: Integration phase—new equilibrium with hybrid human-AI teams

### Data Points for Blog
- "In 2025, over 40% of enterprises reported using AI agents for at least one business function" (Gartner)
- Average productivity gains: 20-40% for knowledge workers using AI assistants
- Reskilling urgency: 50% of workers will need upskilling by 2027 (WEF)

### Research Gaps
- [ ] Find 2026-specific employment data (most studies are 2023-2025)
- [ ] Look for sector-specific case studies
- [ ] Get data on wage impacts, not just job numbers

## 4. Skills That Remain Uniquely Human

### Core Human Advantages

**1. Complex Judgment in Ambiguous Situations**
- Ethical decision-making with competing values
- Reading subtext, nuance, and unstated concerns
- Making calls with incomplete information and high stakes
- Examples: Medical triage, legal strategy, crisis leadership

**2. Genuine Empathy & Emotional Intelligence**
- Understanding and responding to human emotions authentically
- Building trust through vulnerability and presence
- Providing comfort in grief, uncertainty, or fear
- Examples: Therapy, hospice care, conflict mediation

**3. Creative Synthesis & Vision**
- Combining unrelated ideas in novel ways
- Defining problems worth solving
- Imagining futures that don't yet exist
- Examples: Entrepreneurship, artistic direction, research questions

**4. Physical Dexterity in Unstructured Environments**
- Fine motor skills in unpredictable settings
- Adapting to unique physical spaces
- Multi-sensory problem-solving
- Examples: Plumbing, surgery, construction, artisan crafts

**5. Relational Trust & Collaboration**
- Building long-term relationships
- Navigating office politics and unwritten rules
- Creating psychological safety in teams
- Examples: Leadership, sales, teaching, coaching

**6. Cross-Domain Adaptation**
- Applying lessons from one field to another
- Learning entirely new skills quickly
- Recognizing patterns across disciplines
- Examples: Innovation roles, consulting, strategy

### The "Automation Resistant" Profile
Jobs least likely to be fully automated share these traits:
- High variability (every situation is different)
- Requires physical presence and dexterity
- Depends on deep human trust
- Involves high-stakes judgment calls
- Centers on human connection

### Research Note
AI is getting better at narrow aspects of these (e.g., sentiment analysis for empathy, generative art for creativity), but struggles with the integration, context-sensitivity, and relational depth that humans provide naturally.
