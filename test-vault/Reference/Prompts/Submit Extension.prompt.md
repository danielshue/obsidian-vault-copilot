# Submit My Extension to Catalog

I want to submit an extension to the Vault Copilot Extensions catalog.

**My extension details:**
- Extension folder path: [USER: provide your extension path, e.g., extensions/agents/my-agent]
- GitHub username: [USER: provide your GitHub username]

**Please help me:**
1. Validate my extension files and manifest
2. Check my GitHub setup (fork, auth)
3. Create a submission branch
4. Commit and push my extension
5. Create a pull request to the main repository

Walk me through each step and let me know if anything needs to be fixed before proceeding.
