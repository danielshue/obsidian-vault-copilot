**Critical path items:**

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Blockers:**
- Expert interviews hard to schedule → Start outreach immediately, have backup sources
- Missing data on local specifics → Use regional/national data, note as estimates
- Research taking longer than expected → 3-day buffer built into timeline

**Quality Checkpoints:**
- After Phase 1: Do we have enough specific data for credibility?
- After Phase 3: Does the draft answer the reader's core questions?
- Before Phase 4: Would this help someone actually start a food truck?
