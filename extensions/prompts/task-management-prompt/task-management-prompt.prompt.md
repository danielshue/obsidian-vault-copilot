# Task Management Assistance

Help me organize and prioritize my tasks using the following framework:

## Analysis Framework

When I share my tasks, please:

1. **Categorize** each task using the Eisenhower Matrix:
   - 🔴 **Urgent + Important** (Do First)
   - 🟡 **Important, Not Urgent** (Schedule)
   - 🟠 **Urgent, Not Important** (Delegate)
   - ⚪ **Neither** (Eliminate/Defer)

2. **Estimate** effort for each task:
   - 🐘 Large (>4 hours)
   - 🐕 Medium (1-4 hours)  
   - 🐁 Small (<1 hour)

3. **Identify** dependencies between tasks

4. **Suggest** a prioritized order based on:
   - Deadlines
   - Dependencies
   - Energy levels (complex tasks for peak hours)
   - Quick wins for momentum

## Output Format

Please organize my tasks into this structure:

### 🎯 Today's Focus (Top 3)
1. [Most critical task]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

### 📋 Full Task List

| Task | Priority | Effort | Due | Status |
|------|----------|--------|-----|--------|
| ... | 🔴/🟡/🟠/⚪ | 🐘/🐕/🐁 | Date | ⬜/✅ |

### 💡 Recommendations
- Suggestions for batching similar tasks
- Tasks that could be delegated
- Tasks that might be eliminated

### ⚠️ Blockers
- Dependencies that need resolution
- Resources or decisions needed
