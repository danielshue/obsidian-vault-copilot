      "changes": [
        "Added new YAML frontmatter with agent runtime configuration fields (`name`, `description`, `model: gpt-4o`) and expanded capabilities metadata.",
        "Added new tools to support incremental edits and interactive flows: `update_note`, `ask_question`, plus task-oriented tools (`get_tasks`, `create_task`, `list_tasks`, `mark_tasks`).",
        "Added `skills` support for `obsidian-tasks`.",
        "Added a full “Brief overview” section describing two explicit workflows: **Create mode** (create today’s note if missing) and **Update mode** (pick a specific section to work on).",
        "Added detailed safety model for updates:",
        "Added multiple new feature areas not present before:",
        "Added a comprehensive “Usage instructions” guide with a 4-step flow:",
        "Added explicit rewrite/data-handling rules by content type:",
        "Added a “Task management behavior (high level)” section detailing supported task operations (add/complete/review/reschedule/remove) and formatting rules (emoji placement relative to description/tags).",
        "Added a new “Examples” section with three step-by-step scenarios:",
        "Replaced the previous website-style metadata block (e.g., `layout`, `title`, `permalink`, `identifier`, `version`, `author`, `repository`, `license`, `categories`, `tags`, `last_updated`, `size`, and embedded `versions` history) with an agent-focused configuration frontmatter and removed the embedded historical release listing from the README content.",
        "Expanded and reframed the agent from a “structured journal entries with gratitude and goals” assistant into a **section-focused**, **incremental update** journaling assistant that avoids overwriting unrelated sections.",
        "Changed the feature presentation from a short emoji-based bullet list (Structured Entries / Goal Tracking / Pattern Recognition / Guided Prompts / Smart Linking) to a detailed, multi-level feature specification including creation, safe section updates, rewrite modes, append-only sections, tasks, and mood/energy tracking.",
        "Changed “Usage” from three short invocation examples (start day / evening reflection / review themes) to an end-to-end operational guide that explains the agent’s tool-driven sequence and decision points.",
        "Changed the journaling model from a fixed “Each entry includes” list to a selectable section workflow where the user chooses what to work on, including new section options (Tasks, Mood & Energy, Add Related Links).",
        "Changed tool documentation from a simple “Tools Used” purpose table to step-by-step behavior describing *when and why* tools are called (including `update_note` and previews) and how frontmatter is updated (`modified-date`).",
        "Implemented explicit content-safety constraints missing from v1.0.0 documentation: section-scoped updates, append-only behavior for Daily Log/Related, and verbatim preservation rules for structured data (especially tasks), reducing the risk of overwriting unrelated content during updates.",
        "Removed the previous README’s “Installation” instructions that referenced copying `daily-journal-agent.agent.md` to `Reference/Agents/`.",
        "Removed the previous “Tools Used” markdown table that listed tool purposes.",
        "Removed the previous “Tips” section (journaling consistency, honesty, gratitude on hard days, linking advice).",
        "Removed the previous “Changelog” section embedded in the README (v1.0.0 bullets).",
        "Removed explicit mention of v1.0.0 features around **pattern recognition across previous entries** and “smart linking” as automatic suggestions; the new README instead focuses on updating today’s note safely and appending related wikilinks to a dedicated section."
