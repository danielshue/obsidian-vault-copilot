      "changes": [
        "Added YAML frontmatter for the agent definition (name, description, model, tools, skills) instead of the prior website-style metadata block.",
        "Added new tools and capabilities: `update_note`, `ask_question`, and task tooling (`get_tasks`, `create_task`, `list_tasks`, `mark_tasks`) plus the **obsidian-tasks** skill.",
        "Added explicit two-mode workflow documentation: **Create mode** (create today’s daily note if missing) and **Update mode** (edit specific sections in an existing note).",
        "Added detailed guidance on **section-by-section updates** including “read before edit,” updating `modified-date`, and enforcing append-only behavior for accumulating sections.",
        "Added guided, one-question-at-a-time prompt flows (via `ask_question`) for multiple sections, including new check-in and linking flows.",
        "Added **writing style controls** (full narrative / light polish / exact words) with rules about when narrative rewriting applies and when structured data must remain verbatim.",
        "Added full **task management inside the journal** documentation, including supported actions (add/complete/review/reschedule/remove) and emoji-based task metadata conventions (e.g., 📅 due dates, ⏫ priority).",
        "Added **frontmatter-based tracking** details for mood, energy, goals progress (frontmatter array), and preserving tags/structured fields unless explicitly changed.",
        "Added a step-by-step “Usage instructions” section covering session start, section selection, preview-then-save, and continuing/stopping.",
        "Added three concrete usage scenarios as examples: “first session of the day,” “midday daily log append,” and “task add + completion.”",
        "Replaced the prior README structure (Features / Installation / Usage / Journal Structure / Tools Used / Tips / Changelog / License) with an expanded, operational guide emphasizing safe incremental updates and task + frontmatter workflows.",
        "Changed the agent’s scope from primarily “structured prompts + pattern recognition + smart links” to a **section-focused editor** that updates only intended regions and avoids overwriting the rest of the daily note.",
        "Expanded and reorganized the **Features** section from a short bullet list to a multi-level breakdown covering creation, safe updates, guided prompts, writing styles, task management, and frontmatter tracking.",
        "Changed “Usage” examples from simple quoted prompts to procedural, numbered walkthroughs and explicit user choices (section selection, action selection, confirmation before saving).",
        "Changed the “Tools Used” presentation from a two-column table to inline tool references within feature bullets and workflow steps.",
        "Removed the prior website/extension metadata fields (layout, title, permalink, identifier, type, version, author/URLs, repository/license URLs, categories, tags, last_updated, size, versions history block).",
        "Removed the dedicated **Installation** section and its manual-copy guidance (`daily-journal-agent.agent.md` to `Reference/Agents/`).",
        "Removed the explicit **Journal Structure** bullet list (Morning Intentions, Gratitude, Daily Log, Goals Progress, Evening Reflection, Related Links) as a standalone section, replacing it with section-driven workflows and prompts.",
        "Removed the **Tips** section (consistency, honesty, gratitude on hard days, linking guidance) in favor of workflow/behavioral rules.",
        "Removed the in-README **Changelog** section for v1.0.0 and the standalone **License** section text (“MIT”).",
        "Removed previously listed capabilities around **pattern recognition** (“identify trends” across previous entries) and **automatic smart linking suggestions** as headline features in the feature list."
