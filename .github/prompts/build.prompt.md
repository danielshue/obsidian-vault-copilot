---
Build and deploy the Obsidian Vault Copilot plugin to the test vault for local testing.

## Steps

1. Run `npm test` to execute unit tests. **All tests must pass before proceeding.** If any test fails, stop and fix the failures before building.
2. Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript and bundle with esbuild
3. Run `node deploy.mjs` to copy artifacts to the test vault

## Expected Output

The deploy script copies these files to `test-vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-vault-copilot/`:
- main.js
- manifest.json
- styles.css

## After Deployment

Open the test vault folder in Obsidian and enable the plugin in Settings → Community plugins to test changes.
